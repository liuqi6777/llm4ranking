Bone, cartilage, fat (adipose tissue), and blood are all specialized forms of connective tissue. What makes them radically different is the composition of their ground substance.n this lesson, you will learn what fibroblasts are, what substances they produce, and why they are so important to every organ system in your body. At the end of the lesson, a short quiz will test your knowledge.\n[3] The main function of fibroblasts is to maintain the structural integrity of connective tissues by continuously secreting precursors of the extracellular matrix. Fibroblasts secrete the precursors of all the components of the extracellular matrix, primarily the ground substance and a variety of fibers. The composition of the extracellular matrix determines the physical properties of connective tissues. Like other cells of connective tissue, fibroblasts are derived from primitive mesenchyme.\n[4] in connective tissue the ground substance is an amorphous gel like substance surrounding the cells in a tissue cells are surrounded and supported by an extracellular matrix ground substance traditionally does not include fibers collagen and elastic fibers but does include all the other components of the extracellular matrix the components of the ground substance vary depending on the tissue\n[5] In addition to fibers, the intercellular matrix of connective tissue contains an amorphous ground substance. It is within this ground substance that the various fibers and cells are embedded. The ground substance consists of a poorly-staining macromolecular meshwork combined with a large volume of tissue fluid.\n[6] The fibroblasts are the most common cell responsible for the production of soft tissues' fibers and ground substance. Variations of fibroblasts, like chondroblasts, may also produce these substances.\n[7] Generally, the ground substance consists of. polysaccharides and proteins, which are secreted by the connective tissue cells. The ground substance can range from liquid (blood and lymph) to semi-solid (cartilage) to solid (bone). The three types of protein fibers found in connective tissue are. collagen fibers, elastic fibers, and reticular fibers.\n[8] Fibroblasts are by far the most common native cell type of connective tissue. The fibroblast synthesizes the collagen and ground substance of the extracellular matrix. These cells make a large amount of protein that they secrete to build the connective tissue layer.\n[9] Normally the soft tissue is very hydrated because of the ground substance. The fibroblasts are the most common cell responsible for the production of soft tissues' fibers and ground substance. Variations of fibroblasts, like chondroblasts, may also produce these substances.\n[10] MATRIX: Connective tissue matrix is composed of: ground substance and fibers. Ground substance. In ordinary connective tissue, the ground substance consists of water stabilized by glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, and glycoproteins. In bone the ground substance includes minerals. In blood, the ground substance is fluid (plasma). Fibers\n[11] Ground substance and fibers. extracellular matrix, which surrounds connective tissue cells, consists of a variety of different protein fibers and a ground substance. The type of fibers and components of the ground substance varies depending on the tissue type. Generally, the ground substance consists of.\n[12] A skeletal fiber is. 10 nm to 15 nm in diameter and its main content is fibrillin. The. homogeneous substances are highly elastic structural proteins. called elastins. Ground substance, a gelatinous amorphous substance of sugar. and proteins, is observed in between fibers and between cells in. the dermis. The components of ground substance are principally proteo-. glycans and glycoproteins whose molecular weight is 150,000 to. 250,000 and whose sugar content is 2% to 15%.\n[13] The material between the cells of connective tissue consists of fibers and an amorphous gel-like component called the ground substance. The potential importance of the ground substance is readily apparent; for it is through this material that nutrients supplied by the blood diffuse. A large part of connective tissue proper is composed of extracellular material produced primarily by the fibroblasts. 2 The extracellular material consists of a gel-like substance called the ground substance, and fibers.\n[14] Fibroblasts are by far the most common native cell type of connective tissue. The fibroblast synthesizes the collagen and ground substance of the extracellular matrix. These cells make a large amount of protein that they secrete to build the connective tissue layer. Some fibroblasts have a contractile function; these are called myofibroblasts. Chondrocytes and osteocytes form the extracellular matrix of cartilage and bone.\n[15] Fibroblast.

Cartilage is a specialized form of connective tissue produced by differentiated fibroblast-like cells called chondrocytes. It is characterized by a prominent extracellular matrix consisting of various proportions of connective tissue fibers embedded in a gel-like matrix.\n[18] EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX. The extracellular matrix of connective tissue is composed of ground substance and fibers. In ordinary connective tissue, the ground substanc e consists mainly of water.

One component of the six-week postpartum visit is the assessment of the rectus abdominis muscles. Separation of these muscles is normal during pregnancy as the muscles and connective tissue stretch and thin to accommodate your baby. It can take several months for these muscles to begin to heal and move closer together after giving birth.\n[2] While overall weight gain may be a problem, the abdomen and breasts are two areas which are especially susceptible to significant changes. Stomach muscles may lose their tone after pregnancy because both muscles and skin have stretched to accommodate the baby. Many times these changes can, with a lot of exercise and self-massage by the mother, return to a normal state. Pregnancy also causes the breasts to enlarge.\n[3] Remember not to flatten your back and to keep the curve of your spine relaxed. When your abdominal muscles are contracted it helps to stabilize your pelvis while your legs and lower tummy muscles work. This prevents strain in your back muscles, and trains your abdominal muscles to protect and support your spine.ot all abs exercises are suitable for postpartum moms. Traditional abdominal exercises, such as sit-ups and crunches, put too much stress on a postpartum tummy and back, and are not recommended for new moms. The exercises below are the best place to start.\n[4] 1\/17\/12 10:49 A. If you've had children, your pouch may actually be diastasis recti. If so, things like crunches, certain pilates moves, etc. can actually make things worse, as it's basically a separation of your abdominal muscles that happens to quite a few women during pregnancy and childbirth.\n[5] 1 Until your doctor says it is okay, do not lift anything heavier than your baby. 2 Do not do sit-ups or other exercises that strain the belly muscles for 6 weeks or until your doctor says it is okay. Hold a pillow over your incision when you cough or take deep breaths. This will support your belly and reduce your pain.\n[6] The separation between your stomach muscles will usually go back to normal by the time your baby is eight weeks old. If the gap is still obvious at eight weeks the muscles may still be long and weak.This can put you at risk of back problems. Have a word with your health visitor or GP.he separation between your stomach muscles will usually go back to normal by the time your baby is eight weeks old. If the gap is still obvious at eight weeks the muscles may still be long and weak.\n[7] 1 They'll strengthen vital muscles and improve your shape. See Your body after childbirth for practical information on some important exercises. Join a postnatal exercise class or try the NHS Fitness Studio postnatal yoga class. Many postnatal classes let you do the exercise class with your baby at the side of the room. Some exercise classes sometimes allow the baby and buggy in as part of the workout. Ask your health visitor if she knows of any in your area.\n[8] TUMMY TUCK AFTER PREGNANCY. Many women lose their abdominal muscle strength and gain excess skin as a result of having children. As a result of their childbirth, they have acquired a belly that sticks out disproportionately to the rest of their body.\n[9] The separation between your stomach muscles will usually go back to normal by the time your baby is eight weeks old. If the gap is still obvious at eight weeks, the muscles may still be long and weak. This can put you at risk of back problems. Have a word with your health visitor or GP.\n[10] Because of the strain on your stomach muscles and if you think about it would you want to pull out all the stitches holding everything together inside your resulting in another visit to the hospital and operation. You should be o k after a weeks or so and it is important not to overdo it for the first couple of weeks.\n[11] Just the thought of a pregnant woman with a six-pack was so funny to me I couldn't shake it from my mind. My reply to my little son included a graphic description of how the muscles of a woman's abdomen are stretched during pregnancy and, no, there's no way she can have a six pack. No way at all. Sigh....That being said, what exactly DOES happen to a woman's abdominal muscles during pregnancy?\n[12] You core is weaker, but take caution with the crunches 6 of 10. It may seem like crunches are a great idea for targeting post-pregnancy girth, but not so fast. Many women (a third of first time moms, and many more second time moms) find they have a gap between their stomach muscles after pregnancy.\n[13] My reasons were purely vain but after each birth I wrapped my stomach for two to three months without incident. I wanted to get back into my street clothes and get my figure back as quickly as possible. The wrap sort of forces you to hold in your tummy tightening the muscles back up.\n[14] Getting Back into Shape After Baby. It's been a long nine months of your body changing, often in ways that you may not like. Now that your baby is born, you find yourself with a mushy tummy, a few extra pounds and a whole bunch of new stretch marks. Where did your pre-pregnancy body go and will it ever come back? Exercise can help you regain your shape, although it won't do much for your stretch marks.\n[15] They do separate and have a gap in the middle for your uterus to grow. So it is obviously important to not do any abdo crunches when pregnant! After the baby is born, some people's muscles do not go back easily and they get a 'separated rectus sheath' which just needs some exercises and physio to sort out. It gives people a sort of ointy tummy when they sit up and stuff like that.\n[16] I had a c-section, so my stomach isn't as firm as it used to be, but then again, I haven't done much in the way of stomach exercises. Each woman is unique in how she loses weight, so give your body some time and get out and takes those babies for walks in a stroller when you can.\n[17] I would assume they relax and stretch along with the uterus, since the uterus is a muscle as well. In certain cases though you can have a diastasis recti which is when the most outer layer of muscle splits in the middle and this can cause what looks like a valley in the abs later on after baby is born.\n[18] Keep doing exercises to strengthen your tummy muscles for at least three months after you've given birth (Lee and Thomas 2009) . It's recommended that you breastfeed your baby for at least six months, to give her the best start in life.\n[19] It depends on how fit you were when you had your baby, and how straightforward your labour was. If you did regular exercise up until the end of your pregnancy, and your baby's birth went smoothly, you can do some light exercise and stretching soon after the birth (ACOG 2002, Davies et al 2003) . You should take up exercise more gradually if you: However, you can begin exercising pelvic floor and lower tummy muscles as soon as you feel ready. Pelvic floor exercises are essential to protect against leaking wee (stress incontinence) after birth (Boyle et al 2012) .\n[20] Stomach Changes. Just after giving birth, your uterus is still hard and round (weighing about 2 1\/2 pounds) and can be felt just by touching your naval. In about six weeks, it will weigh only 2 ounces and will no longer be felt by pressing on your abdomen.\nSearch Query: do stomach muscles weaken after baby.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Remove dish from the oven, and quickly run cold water over the eggs, for 1 minute or so.\n[2] There is substantial variation, with cooking time being the primary variable affecting doneness (soft-boiled vs. hard-boiled). It usually varies from 15\u201317 minutes for large hard-boiled eggs, 1\u20134 minutes for large soft-cooked eggs and 12 minutes for the best results.\n[3] Fill with enough water to cover eggs completely. Bring water to a gentle rolling boil and allow to cook for 1 minute. Turn off heat, cover the pot, and allow eggs to sit in the water for 10-12 minutes. Remove from pot and rinse eggs with cool water. Peel and serve, or store in refrigerator for up to one week. Add chopped hardboiled eggs to salads or eat whole as a snack. Mash 1\/4 of an avocado on a slice of whole grain toast. Top with hardboiled egg slices and a sprinkle of black pepper or red pepper flakes.\n[4] A hard-boiled egg hardly boils at all. Turn the burner under the pot with the eggs to a medium-high heat. As soon as the water reaches a rolling boil, cover the pot and remove it from the heat source.

Transfer the boiled eggs to a cold water bath or bowl of ice to immediately stop the cooking. The shock of the cold helps the egg to peel easier.\n[5] A hard-boiled egg is cooked by placing an egg, shell and all, in boiling water for about 14 minutes, or until the yolk and whites are firm. Hard-boiled eggs may be eaten alone, chopped and made into an egg salad or used as a topping on green salads or soups.\n[6] It usually varies from 15\u201317 minutes for large hard-boiled eggs, 1\u20134 minutes for large soft-cooked eggs. Depending on altitude above sea level and humidity densities in a given climate, one may require extended amounts of time to reach the soft-boiled stage, and in fact, may never reach a fully hard stage.\n[7] To avoid green eggs, hard-cook instead of hard-boiling eggs: 1 Place eggs in a single layer in saucepan. 2 Cover pan and bring to boil; turn off the burner. 3 Let stand for 15 minutes for large eggs (12 minutes for medium eggs and 18 minutes for extra large eggs). 4 Drain. Store hard cooked eggs in the refrigerator and use within 1 week.\n[8] This method works best if the eggs are in a single layer, but you can double them up as well, you'll just need to add more time to the steaming time. 3 Set your timer for 6 minutes for soft boiled, 10 minutes for hard boiled with a still translucent and bright yolk, or 12-15 minutes for cooked-through hard boiled. If you have doubled up the eggs in the pan and they are not in a single layer, you may need to add a couple minutes or so to the cooking time for hard boiled. The size large eggs used in these photos were cooked to my satisfaction after 15 minutes when I cooked 6 in a single layer, and 17 minutes when I cooked 12 in the pan.\n[9] Let the water (with the eggs) boil for about 8-10 minutes. Turn off the heat and let sit for another 5 minutes for hard boiled eggs.

Let's see a good example of how water can be used to generate electricity. As the water rushes down through pipes, this stored energy is transferred to kinetic energy, which turns electricity generators. The Dam is built to retain the water.\n[2] Electrolysis of Water During the early history of the earth, hydrogen and oxygen gasses spontaneously reacted to form the water in the oceans, lakes, and rivers we have today. That spontaneous direction of reaction can be used to create water and electricity in a galvanic cell (as it does on the space shuttle).\n[3] Hydropower is electricity generated using the energy of moving water. Rain or melted snow, usually originating in hills and mountains, create streams and rivers that eventually run to the ocean.The energy of that moving water can be substantial, as anyone who has been whitewater rafting knows.ydropower is the cheapest way to generate electricity today. That's because once a dam has been built and the equipment installed, the energy source\u2014flowing water\u2014is free. It's a clean fuel source that is renewable yearly by snow and rainfall.\n[4] It is the first off-the-shelf waterwheel system which can generate a good supply of electricity from a water fall as little as 20cm. Mr Gilmartin, an electrician and inventor, was not prompted to think up his new device by high energy bills - he does not own a TV and has never lived in a house with electricity.\n[5] Water, or hydropower, is the renewable energy source that produces the most electricity in the United States. In 2009, it accounted for 7 percent of total U.S. electricity generation and 35 percent of generation from renewables in 2009, according to the U.S. Energy Administration.\n[6] You could direct the water through a hose to a generator and produce all the electricity you need. You could also save more battery power through this method. Just a thought, hope you are close to fast moving water or this gives you another idea.\n[7] Converting moving water to electricity. In order to generate electricity from the kinetic energy in moving water, the water has to be moving with sufficient speed and volume to turn a generator. Roughly speaking, one gallon of water per second falling one hundred feet can generate one kilowatt of electrical power.onverting moving water to electricity. In order to generate electricity from the kinetic energy in moving water, the water has to be moving with sufficient speed and volume to turn a generator. Roughly speaking, one gallon of water per second falling one hundred feet can generate one kilowatt of electrical power.\n[8] In fact, humans have been capturing the energy of moving water for thousands of years. Today, harnessing the power of moving water to generate electricity, known as hydroelectric power, is the largest source of emissions-free, renewable electricity in the United States and worldwide.\n[9] Water, when it is falling by the force of gravity, can be used to turn. turbines and generators that produce electricity. Hydroelectric power is important to our Nation. Growing populations and modern technologies. require vast amounts of electricity for creating, building, and expanding.\n[10] Converting moving water to electricity. In order to generate electricity from the kinetic energy in moving water, the water has to be moving with sufficient speed and volume to turn a generator. Roughly speaking, one gallon of water per second falling one hundred feet can generate one kilowatt of electrical power.\n[11] Tweet. According to IEEE Spectrum energy from water makes up about one-fifth of the world's electricity or about 900 gigawatts; the trend will continue due to a large number of powerful rivers and hydro's low cost vis-a-vis other sources of renewable energy.\n[12] Electrolysis of water ship Hydrogen Challenger. Production of hydrogen from water requires large amounts of energy and is uncompetitive with its production from coal or natural gas. Potential electrical energy supplies include hydropower, wind turbines, or photovoltaic cells. Usually, the electricity consumed is more valuable than the hydrogen produced so this method has not been widely used. Other potential energy supplies include heat from nuclear reactors and light from the sun. Hydrogen can also be used to store renewable generated electricity when it is not needed (like the wind blowing at night) and then used to meet power needs during the day or to fuel vehicles.\n[13] 1 Water turbines require a source of flowing water and a source of water that is high above. 2 The kinetic energy of the falling water is used to drive the turbines. 3 Large waterfalls are good sources of water that is high above the turbine and can be used in large volume to generate electricity. Burning fossil fuels can produce heat which boils water to make steam. 2 There are many fossil fuel-powered electric plants in New Jersey and surrounding states. 3 Solar energy can be used to make electricity on a limited or small scale basis, for example, to power a calculator or to heat an individual home or building.\n[14] When water flows or falls, energy can be generated. The generation of energy through water is usually carried out in large water power plants, with a number of process steps and the use of several devices, such as turbines and generators. The energy in water can be used to produce electricity.\n[15] Converting moving water to electricity. In order to generate electricity from the kinetic energy in moving water, the water has to move with sufficient speed and volume to spin a propeller-like device called a turbine, which in turn rotates a generator to generate electricity.\n[16] When you think about how amazing and powerful water is, it's not too surprising to think of how useful it can be to us. Humans have long used water as a source of power and energy, and when we use passing water to generate electrical energy, we call this hydroelectric energy.\n[17] Moving water can be used to produce energy because potential energy can be converted into kinetic energy. Stored water is converted into kinetic energy. As the water travels, \u2026it is converted into electrical energy by having it turn a generator.\n[18] 1 Hydroelectric power plants use water in a different way, converting the energy in falling water into electricity by passing it through turbines. 2 Fuel Extraction and Production \u2013 Water is a critical resource for the drilling and mining of natural gas, coal, oil, and uranium.ater is involved at many points in the process of producing electricity: 1 Electricity Generation \u2013 More than 90 percent of U.S. power plants need cooling. 2 These types of power plants are called thermoelectric because they use a heat source to produce steam for generating electricity.\n[19] Usually by means of a water turbine. These devices are like highly complex water wheels (spun by falling water) that are coupled to an electrical generator. <br \/><br \/> It is never water itself that generates electricity, but rather the <i>movement<\/i> of water.\n[20] Water use in electricity generation. Many types of power plants generate electricity by boiling water to produce steam, which is then passed through a turbine. Such plants include ones that burn coal and biomass, nuclear plants, some natural gas plants, and even some solar facilities.\nSearch Query: can water generate electricity.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Hi Everyone, My partner and I have booked a trip to Thailand for end of Sept\/October. We will be staying in Pattaya for a week then want to go down to Phuket. Having gone on a few websites it seems that this could be a bad idea due to the weather.\n[2] Guide to Pattaya weather in September The average maximum daytime temperature in Pattaya in September is a hot 31\u00b0C (88\u00b0F) with very high heat & humidity. The average night-time temperature is usually a warm 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F).\n[3] What is the weather like in Thailand in august and september? I am thinking of going on holiday to Thailand around late August and early September 2009. But i have heard that around these months it is monsoon season.\n[4] Because of the wet weather it is still low season in Thailand tourism-wise, but visitors who do come on holiday in October enjoy the quieter conditions and the constant high temperatures, which average 31\u00b0C (87.8\u00b0F) across the whole country \u2013 a little cooler in the north where Chiang Mai's average for the month is 27\u00b0C (80.6\u00b0F).\n[5] Key weather averages for Pattaya in September. 1 31. 31\u00b0C max day temperature. 2 5. 5 hours of sunshine per day. 3 17. 17 days with some rainfall. 4 25. 25\u00b0C min night temperature. 5 12. 12 hours of daylight per day. 6 VH. Very High heat & humidity. 7 259. 259 mm of monthly rainfall. 8 11. 11+ (Extreme) UV index. 9 29. 29\u00b0C sea temperature.\n[6] Weather in Phuket in September usually shows a mix of sun and rain, but with more rainy days than sunny, so September is not the best month to travel to Phuket. Weather in October October weather in Phuket is not much different from weather in September, again a mix of sun and rain, also not the best month to visit to Phuket if you have a choice. To be on the positive side and if you have no choice, this time of the year is the most challenging lucky draw.\n[7] Eastern Thailand. Temperatures will be around the same as Bangkok and Central Thailand, though there will be a little more rain \u2014 perhaps 3 to 4 days of rain in the month. Despite the slight extra rain, this is one of the best times of the year weather-wise to visit the eastern islands like Ko Chang and Ko Kut.\n[8] Phuket has a tropical monsoonal climate. It's warm all year round, but the two periods of April-May and September-October are the hottest. The September-October period is also the wettest due to the southwest monsoon. Phuket is blessed by being in a temperate zone. Even though typhoons and tropical storms occasionally batter Hong Kong and the Philippines, Phuket enjoys mild weather and while the heavier rains in September and October can disrupt things a little, it's rare that the island has several consecutive days of heavy rain.\nSearch Query: how is the weather in thailand in september.\nRank the 8 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Of or relating to electric charges at rest. b. Produced or caused by such charges. 2.\n[2] Printer (computing) Liquid ink electrostatic printers use a chemical coated paper, which is charged by the print head according to the image of the document.(15) The paper is passed near a pool of liquid ink with the opposite charge. The charged areas of the paper attract the ink and thus form the image.\n[3] HP's electrostatic plotters were all made by the Matsushita Corporation of Japan. The electrostatic plotter market collapsed very quickly after the introduction of the large-format inkjet plotters (the DesignJet Series) in the early 1990s. The inkjet plotters offered a much lower capital and opearting cost structure than the electrostatic plotters.\n[4] Laser printing is an electrostatic digital printing process. It produces high-quality text and graphics (and moderate-quality photographs) by repeatedly passing a laser beam back and forth over a negatively charged cylinder called a drum to define a differentially charged image.\n[5] A plotter is a printer that interprets commands from a computer to make line drawings on paper with one or more automated pens.\n[6] Setting up a design for the cutter plotter. A cutter plotter is a professional tool that creates custom designs by cutting out shapes from the material support you provide. It features a mechanic cutter guided by designs such as those you can create with SignGo. The software allows you to draw the layout of your sign, by offering you a wide array of professional designing tools. Aside from the various color schemes, you may also use transparency or texture fill, for artistic effects.\n[7] Electrostatic plotter. An electrostatic plotter is a type of plotter that draws images on paper with an electrostatic process. They are most frequently used for Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE), producing raster images via either a Liquid Toner or a Dry Toner model.\n[8] Versatec made large-format electrostatic (raster) plotters. Most of the profitability in this business came from the sales of consumables. In 1988, HP introduced its 7600 Series electrostatic plotters: the A1\/D size 240D (C1600A, $22,900), and the A0\/E size 240E (C1601A, $27,500). These first two models were monochrome. HP introduced its color electrostatic plotter in 1990, the Model 355 (C1620A, $45,900).\n[9] Electrostatic plotter An electrostatic plotter is a type of plotter that draws images on paper with an electrostatic process. They are most frequently used for Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE), producing raster images via either a Liquid Toner or a Dry Toner model.\n[10] Part of the Multimedia and graphics glossary: A plotter is a printer that interprets commands from a computer to make line drawings on paper with one or more automated pens. Unlike a regular printer, the plotter can draw continuous point-to-point lines directly from vector graphics files or commands.\n[11] An electrostatic plotter is a type of plotter that draws images on paper with an electrostatic process. They are most frequently used for Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE), producing raster images via either a Liquid Toner or a Dry Toner model.\n[12] Unlike a pen plotter, the plot time of a rasterized electrostatic plotter was independent of the level of detail of the image. Modern electrostatic color plotters are found in the short run graphics industry, printing on a variety of paper or plastic film surfaces.\n[13] Laser printing is an electrostatic digital printing process. It produces high-quality text and graphics (and moderate-quality photographs) by repeatedly passing a laser beam back and forth over a negatively charged cylindrical drum to define a differentially-charged image.\n[14] A plotter is a computer vector graphic printer that gives a hard copy of the output based on instructions from the system. Plotters are widely used to print designs of things such as cars, ships and buildings on a piece of paper using a pen. Plotters are different than a printer in that they are more precise and they are most commonly used in engineering, where precision is mandatory. They are also more expensive than ordinary printers. A plotter is also known as a graph plotter.\n[15] When an image or text is sent to the printer, after immediately being converted to digitized lines of colored or neutral dots, an electrostatic charge via a primary charge roller (or corona wire) is sent to the imaging drum. This electrostatic charge essentially contains the image or text to be printed.\n[16] Electrostatic flocking equipment is available in three configurations: 1 an automatic carousel for multicolor flocking. 2 a single station flocking unit that usually attaches to one station of a garment press. 3 a portable hand-held unit for lower volumes.\n[17] Part of the Multimedia and graphics glossary: A plotter is a printer that interprets commands from a computer to make line drawings on paper with one or more automated pens.\n[18] Unlike electrostatic plotters and other ink-jet printers that often require special front-end hardware and software packages that can drive system costs well over $100,000, the $19,995 DisplayMaker connects directly to a user's existing Macintosh(R) and\/or IBM- compatible computers or computer network.\n[19] Electrostatic lens. An electrostatic lens is a device that assists in the transport of charged particles.(1)(2)(3) For instance, it can guide electrons emitted from a sample to an electron analyzer, analogous to the way an optical lens assists in the transport of light in an optical instrument.\nSearch Query: what is electrostatic plotter.\nRank the 19 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

The Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, sometimes more simply referred to as the Battle of Spotsylvania (or the 19th-century spelling Spottsylvania), was the second major battle in Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's 1864 Overland Campaign of the American Civil War.\n[2] The Battle of Spotsylvania. The Battle of Spotsylvania, which began on the morning of May 8, lasted 12 days, only ending on May 19. We'll take a brief look at each day's events in order to capture the overall scope of the battle.\n[3] On May 5, 1864, the Union Army of the Potomac once again locked horns with the Army of Northern Virginia in the dense thickets known as the Wilderness of Spotsylvania. Over the course of two days, the two armies fought to a bloody stalemate, inaugurating a new era of violence in the war in the East.\n[4] Spotsylvania County, Virginia. Following the Battle of the Wilderness, Grant marched the Union army south with the hope of capturing Spotsylvania Court House. Lee's Confederates, however, managed to get ahead of the Federals and block the road. For the next two weeks, the two armies slugged it out in some of the fiercest fighting of the Civil War.\n[5] By Cowan BrewThe two weeks of horrific fighting around the tiny crossroads hamlet of Spotsylvania Court House, Virginia, in May 1864 represented a watershed of sorts for Robert E. Lee, Ulysses S. Grant and the armies they commanded. Even for veterans [\u2026].\n[6] The Battle of Spotsylvania took place because General Grant wanted to move past General Lee and the Confederate army's right flank. His ultimate goal was to prevent Genera \u2026 l Lee from getting to Richmond and he chose Spotsylvania as the place to prevent this from happening.\n[7] The Battle of Spotsylvania Courthouse pitted the Union army, led by Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant, against the Confederates led by General Robert E. Lee. Grant was actively pursuing his goals of capturing the Confederate capitol of Richmond and wearing out the Confederate army through repeated strong attacks.\n[8] The enterprise was abandoned. Farther to the left, a portion of the 6th Corps carried the first line of the Confederate entrenchments, and captured 900 prisoners and several guns. Then the first day's real battle at Spotsylvania Courthouse was ended.\n[9] Why was the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House important? The Battle of Spotsylvania Court House continued the bleeding of Lee's army that began in the Wilderness. Grant recognized that Richmond was not his primary objective \u2013 the real heart of the Confederacy was Lee's Army.

This meant the ancient ancestors of the wildcats were likely the first cats to be domesticated.\n[3] It's plausible that the ancient [domestic cat] lineages were present in the wildcat populations back as far as 70,000 or 100,000 years ago, said study co-author Stephen O'Brien of the National Cancer Institute in Frederick, Maryland.\n[4] Domestic cats have been traced back to a single wild ancestor whose relatives still live in the remote deserts of the Middle East today.The transformation of a vicious predator into a docile tabby took place some 10,000 years ago, a new genetic analysis suggests.he DNA from domestic cats matched up with that of the Near Eastern wildcat subspecies Felis silvestris lybica, which lives in the remote deserts of Israel and Saudi Arabia. They detail the results this week in the online version of the journal Science.\n[5] Theories of domestic cat's For decades, many theories have existed to explain the origin of cats. Traditionally, most scholars believed that all domestic cats had a common ancestor in ancient Egypt, where cats were domesticated around 3,600 years ago. Other researchers believed that domestic cats had more than one ancestor, the result of domestication occurring at different times and places, each resulting in a distinct ancestral breed 1.\n[6] A. A 2007 study of genes from 997 individual cats, both wild and domestic, points to common ancestors of domestic cats among the Near Eastern wildcat, Felis sylvestris lybica, one of the five subspecies of wildcat still found around the Old World.imes Topic: Q & A. The article, published in the journal Science, said that the domestic cats in the study shared at least five matriarchal lineages, as traced by mitochondrial DNA. The earliest evidence found of cats living with humans was a cat burial in Cyprus from about 9,500 years ago, reported in 2004.\n[7] Confidence votes 9.7K. There has been much debate over the origins of the domestic cat over the last century or so. It is most likely that the African wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica), is the ancestor of the modern domestic cat.t was a small predator, slightly larger than a modern domestic cat. Proailurus is thought to be to be a likely ancestor to Pseudaelurus, prehistoric cat that lived 20-8 million years ago. Pseudaelurus is the ancestor of today's cats, as well as the famous sabre-tooth cats.\n[8] The Origin of the Domestic Cat, Revealed by DNA. In the case of cats, we really have doubts on whether they are really domestic or just live with us under the same roof.But as any domestic animal, cats too come from a wild animal. But the wild species (Felis sylvestris) lives in Africa, Europe and half of Asia.ow DNA analysis have detected the house cat's maternal ancestors back to the Fertile Crescent (Egypt-Israel-Mesopotamia (today Iraq)-Syria-Cyprus). The Middle Eastern wild ancestors still wander through the deserts of the area.\n[9] Once turned into household companions, cats accompanied prehistoric human tribes in their migration worldwide, explaining the origin of all domestic cats from the same stock. In the same way, domestic cats from Europe are really the same as domestic cats from Israel or China or wherever. said Driscoll. The oldest remains of a domestic cat have been discovered in Cyprus, being about 9,500 years old.\n[10] This genetic analysis showed that all domestic cats descended only from F. silvestris lybica, not the European Wildcat (F. silvestris silvestris) or any of the other subspecies. Mitochondrial DNA evidence shows at least five founders\u2014ancestral individuals whose DNA is present in modern populations.\n[11] The evolution of the domestic house cat is not as straightforward as you might expect. Twenty-first century science has illuminated some aspects of domestication, but lineages remain murky. In short, all cats probably evolved from the prehistoric proailurus, which was either the last cat precursor or the first cat.\n[12] Scientists have traced today's domestic cat's ancestors to the Fertile Crescent, the birth place of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean civilization. The wildcat that is the basis for your cat's development is still wandering the deserts of Middle Eastern countries, much as she did up to 100,000 years ago.ave. When you watch your cat engage in every day behavior, whether it's jumping onto her cat tree, twitching her tail as she spots a bird out the window or dig around in her litter box, consider that she's the result of more than 10,000 years of evolution.\n[13] The wildcat is the ancestor of the domestic cat. Genetic, morphological and archaeological evidence suggests that domestication of Old-World wildcats began approximately 7500 years BCE in the Fertile Crescent region of the Near East.\n[14] In this research, the scientists sampled a thousand wild and domestic cats, coming from modern wildcat subspecies: the Near Eastern wildcat, the European wildcat, the Central Asian wildcat, the southern African wildcat, and the Chinese desert cat.ow DNA analysis have detected the house cat's maternal ancestors back to the Fertile Crescent (Egypt-Israel-Mesopotamia (today Iraq)-Syria-Cyprus). The Middle Eastern wild ancestors still wander through the deserts of the area.\n[15] There are more than 30 different breeds of domestic cat and it is believed that all originated from the African Wildcat. Domestication is thought to have occurred more than 4000 years ago in Egypt, and originally occurred for religious purposes. All [domestic] cats are related to one another, and they all come from the same place, and that's the Near East\" Driscoll said. Today's domestic cats probably all descend from the wild cat native to the area, Felis s.\n[16] Times Topic: Q & A. The article, published in the journal Science, said that the domestic cats in the study shared at least five matriarchal lineages, as traced by mitochondrial DNA. The earliest evidence found of cats living with humans was a cat burial in Cyprus from about 9,500 years ago, reported in 2004.imes Topic: Q & A.

The earliest evidence found of cats living with humans was a cat burial in Cyprus from about 9,500 years ago, reported in 2004.\n[17] The domestic cat is thought to have evolved from the African wild cat because of its tabby markings. Domestic cats today still take many characteristics from their wild ancestors. The arresting eyes, body shape, feeding and grooming habits are the same along with the ability to pounce into action at any given moment.xcept for a short period of persecution in the Middle Ages when cats were associated with the devil, by the eighteenth century cats had become popular household pets world wide. The wild cats of today such as Lions and Tigers descended from early carnivores called miacids.\n[18] It's well known for many years that the early decendants of the domestic cat (Felis Catus) originated from Egypt and surrounding area 3-9000 years ago by being domesticated through being good and useful mousers to stop grain consumption by them.hile Egypt was the first place thought to actually domesticate the cat, it ORIGINATED in the middle east. They did DNA testing and found the area that our domestic cat actually did start in. Prior to the DNA tests the best guess was that the cat species came from northern Africa, but that was wrong.\n[19] Rating Newest Oldest.

In music, a primary triad is one of the three triads, or three-note chords built from major or minor thirds, most important in tonal and diatonic music, as opposed to an auxiliary triad or secondary triad. Each triad found in a diatonic key corresponds to a particular diatonic function.\n[2] They are Primary Triads. Ex.: The primary triads are most important in the structure of a composition. They have the function of key definitive. 1 A composition should establish its key in the beginning with the notes in Tonic triad and also end with a note in Tonic triad-mainly the tonic note.\n[3] The best-known type of triad is a type of musical chord consisting of three notes. A D-major triad is made up of the notes D, F-sharp, and A; an F-minor triad is made up of F, A-flat, and C; and so on. Major and minor triads form the basis of tonal music, and songs and other pieces usually end with a triadic harmony. In medicine, a triad is a set of three symptoms that go together.\n[4] Triad: Triad, in music, a chord made up of three tones, called chord factors, of the diatonic scale: root, third, and fifth. The system of diatonic triads is the basis of tonal harmony in music. Triads built on the notes of the C major (and natural A minor) scale.\n[5] Lesson 11: Primary and Secondary Triads. On every note of a scale, we can build a triad (1) . 11.1 Primary Triads: The three triads that include all the notes in a scale are Tonic (I), Sub-dominant (IV) and Dominant (V) triads.\n[6] As long as you know the three primary triads belonging to a particular scale or key, you can successfully harmonize any melody based on that scale\/key. For both major and minor scales\/keys the primary triads are those build on the first, fourth and fifth scale degrees of that scale.

The term harmonic triad was coined by Johannes Lippius in his Synopsis musicae novae (1612). When stacked in thirds, the triad's members, from lowest pitched tone to highest, are called: 1 the root. 2 the third \u2013 its interval above the root being a minor third (three semitones) or a major third (four semitones).\n[8] In music, a triad is a set of three notes (or pitches) that can be stacked vertically in thirds.(1) The term harmonic triad was coined by Johannes Lippius in his Synopsis musicae novae (1612).\n[9] triad. 1 A group of three. 2 Music A chord of three tones, especially one built on a given root tone plus a major or minor third and a perfect fifth. 3 A section of a Pindaric ode consisting of the strophe, antistrophe, and epode.\n[10] In very much conventionally tonal music, harmonic analysis will reveal a broad prevalence of the primary (often triadic) harmonies: tonic, dominant, and subdominant (i.e., I and its chief auxiliaries a 5th removed), and especially the first two of these.\n[11] The term \"triad\" encompasses four chords that differ in structure and expressive quality. The division of a perfect fifth into two unequal thirds produces the two main types of triad: major (a major third plus a minor third) and minor (a minor third plus a major third), both of which are consonant.\n[12] In music theory, the dominant triad (3-note chord) is a major triad, symbolized by the Roman numeral V, if it is within the major diatonic scale (for example G-B-D in C major). It is, however, a minor triad, denoted v, if it is within the minor diatonic scale (for example G-B \u266d -D in C minor).ut another way, the key whose tonic is the dominant scale degree in the main key. If, for example, a piece is written in the key of C major, then the key of C is the tonic key. The key of G major is the dominant key since it is based on the dominant note for the key of C major.\n[13] Music Theory\/Chords - Triads. 1 The triad is a class of chords, specifically three-note chords formed by this formula: 1-3-5 or root, third, fifth. In this example they are constructed of two consecutive thirds. 2 There are four kinds...\n[14] The triad built on the first note of the scale is called the the tonic, the dominant, the subdominant, the subtonic\n[15] In tonal Western classical music (music with a tonic key or home key), the most frequently encountered chords are triads, so called because they consist of three distinct notes: the root note, a third above the root note and a fifth interval above the root note.\n[16] When musicians play three different notes at the same time, this creates a chord. In Western music, including classical music, pop music, rock music and many related styles, the most common chords are triads\u2013 three notes usually played at the same time.\n[17] A triad is a chord constructed with 3 notes. When in root position (the root note is on the bottom) each note is a third away from the last (if intervals are new to you check out the intervals tutorial). Triads are a basic chord structure and the basis of how other types of chords are constructed. There are four types of triads: 1 Major. 2 Minor. 3 Augmented. 4 Diminished.\n[18] Look at the following sequence, and see if you recognise a pattern that might help you work out PRIMARY TRIADS:\n[19] The larger third that defines the major triad has a different emotional quality, it seems, from that of the smaller minor third that distinguishes the minor triad. There are other differences between the major and minor scales, of course, but the main thing is that tonic chord to which the music returns home so often.\nSearch Query: what is a primary triad in music.\nRank the 19 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

The location and severity of the headache may change from day to day. People who have rebound headaches also may have nausea, anxiety, irritability, depression, or problems sleeping.\n[19] Researchers believe this is due to the effect oversleeping has on certain neurotransmitters in the brain, including serotonin. People who sleep too much during the day and disrupt their nighttime sleep may also find themselves suffering from headaches in the morning.\n[20] A new study shows that chronic morning headaches are frequently associated with depression and anxiety disorders.

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: which of the senses is described as a chemical sense?.\n\n[1] 4. Smell is the oldest sense. Chemodetection \u2014 detecting chemicals related to smell or taste \u2014 is the most ancient sense, says Malaspina. \"Even a single cell animal has ways to detect the chemical composition of the environment,\" she adds. 5.\n[2] Smell and taste are the chemical senses because their receptors are stimulated by chemical molecules, rather than by energy from light, pressure, or sound. As little as one molecule in a million may be detected by the nose, but it takes a minimum of one part per thousand to stimulate the tongue.\n[3] Chemical Senses: Smell and Taste. 1 Chemical substances must be dissolved in water to excite the receptors for smell and taste. The olfactory (smell) receptors are located in the superior aspect of each nasal cavity (Figure 8.7). Sniffing helps to bring more air (containing odors) over the olfactory mucosa.\n[4] Olfaction, along with taste, is a form of chemoreception. The chemicals themselves that activate the olfactory system, in general at very low concentrations, are called odorants. Although taste and smell are separate sensory systems in land animals, water-dwelling organisms often have one chemical sense.\n[5] Smell or olfaction (adjectival form: olfactory) is the other chemical sense. Unlike taste, there are hundreds of olfactory receptors (388 according to one source), each binding to a particular molecular feature. Odor molecules possess a variety of features and, thus, excite specific receptors more or less strongly.\n[6] Smell, like taste, is a chemical sense detected by sensory cells called chemoreceptors. When an odorant stimulates the chemoreceptors in the nose that detect smell, they pass on electrical impulses to the brain.\n[7] Olfaction, along with taste, is a form of chemoreception. The chemicals that activate the olfactory system, generally at very low concentrations, are called odorants. Although taste and smell are separate sensory systems in land animals, water-dwelling organisms often have one chemical sense.\n[8] \u2022 Taste and smell are chemical senses. They give us information about the. chemical composition of our surroundings. Taste is an immediate sense - a final. checkpoint for the acceptability of food before it enters the body. Smell is a. more distant sense allowing us to detect small concentrations of airborne. substances. \u2022 Taste and smell only separated when animals moved to land. Since in the sea, all chemicals are dissolved in the same medium (water) there is no need for two. separate senses.\n[9] The other 'contact' senses all involve physical contact with the things that are sensed. They are chemical and mechanical. The chemical senses are the olfactory (smell) and gustatory (taste) sensations. Light enters the front of the eye through the pupil and is focused by the lens onto the retina. Rod cells on the retina respond to the light and send a message through the optic nerve fiber to the brain.\n[10] The sense of smell, just like the sense of taste, is a chemical sense. They are called chemical senses because they detect chemicals in the environment, with the difference being that smell works at dramatically larger distances than that of taste.The process of smelling goes more or less like this: Underneath the mucus, in the olfactory epithelium, specialized receptor cells called olfactory receptor neurons detect the odor. 2 These neurons are capable of detecting thousands of different odors. 3 The olfactory receptor neurons transmit the information to the olfactory bulbs, which are located at the back of the nose.\n[11] Best Answer: Its chemical property. Taste and smell are chemical senses. They give us information about the chemical composition of our surroundings. Taste is an immediate sense - a final checkpoint for the acceptability of food before it enters the body. Smell is a more distant sense allowing us to detect small concentrations of airborne substances.

This concerns the corrosion protection strategy and this article will not go into the specific details. Other coolants use various other methods. What is important is always to use what the manufacturer specifies and to do it in the proper manner. GM has used Dexcool coolant in many millions of vehicles since 1996.\n[2] Dexcool is General Motors answer. Dexcool is the name of the antifreeze coolant that Gm advises its buyers to use. I BELIEVE THEY STATE YOU MUST, OR IT VOIDS YOUR WARRANTY......... NOTE : GM HAS HAD A DEXCOOL CLASSACTION SUIT FILED AGAINST THEM. PROVING THAT DEXCOOL EATS AWAY AT YOUR GASKETS. { HEADGASKETS.....} IF YOU DONT KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS.\n[3] If you have a General Motors vehicle manufactured after 1995 you probably have Dex-cool antifreeze. It starts out a beautiful orange color. It looks good enough to drink. In the lab, Dex-cool has properties and characteristics that allow for longer life, less maintenance, and greater protection. But that's in the lab. Under the hood, it's quite often a different story.\n[4] I just recently saw about the Dex-Cool problems and that is what I have been using in my vehicle since that is the kind that is required from the automakers, Patricia said. Dex-Cool is now used in almost 40 million vehicles sold by GM since 1996. On its website, GM claims Dex-Cool will last 5 years or 150,000 miles but a steady stream of consumers insist the product is defective and has damaged their vehicles.\n[5] DexCool, is a long-life coolant. You can use regular coolant in any car that had DexCool. Keeping DexCool supposedly allows for a 5 year coolant life, if you add regular coolant to a car filled with Dex Cool, you then end up changing after 2 years. I do not use it, I now have a clolour change coolant.\n[6] Prestone \u00ae Dex-Cool \u00ae Approved Antifreeze\/Coolant has been approved by General Motors to be licensed as a DEX-COOL \u00ae product under the GM 6277M specification.

Dex-Cool (ethylene glycol) is identical to the Chrysler & General Motors factory fill.\n[13] Re: what color is dex-cool coolant? Its orange, and i would say no, use what he manual says to use, check this out... The difference between Dex Cool and regular antifreeze are in the additives. They are both an ethylene glycol base. Some of the additives in the old green stuff were actually somewhat abrasive to the water pump seal, so that is why Dex Cool gives longer seal life. The additives in the green tended to settle out of suspension, Dex Cool additives don't. The significant difference is how the additives behave toward corrosion.\n[14] Prestone GM pre-mixed Dex-Cool\u00ae is recommended for use in all vehicles that require GM Dex-Cool\u00ae coolant for topping off.\n[15] All the dex cool I have seen is that orange color. I have seen some of the 'universal' stuff that was more of a dark brown but not blue. I have also seen some cars that is a yellow lemonade like color. GM Dexcool is orange only!!!!!! Pretty much the aftermarket coolant we use at our dealership is also orange.\n[16] What color is GM's DexCool? I've had a few mid 90s, early 00s GM cars w\/ the 3.1 or 3.8 engines.

They said they drained the coolant and added new,... show more I've had a few mid 90s, early 00s GM cars w\/ the 3.1 or 3.8 engines.\n[17] The recommended service intervals of Dex-cool coolant is 5 years 100K miles and in some cases 150K miles. These extended service intervals have not proven to be any thing but trouble for the consumer.\n[18] Valvoline \u2122 ZEREX \u2122 Dex-Cool \u00ae Antifreeze\/Coolant is automaker approved for use in GM vehicles which require OAT DEX-COOL \u00ae .

Dexcool alone will turn acidic if the cooling system gets air trapped in it. So to avoid that problem, return the Dexcool and keep using the regular green antifreeze. Tester.\n[20] It is NOT a Dexcool clone, but is supposed to have the advantages of the newer type of coolants, and is supposed to work fine in cars with the green stuff.

Beware, the texture of paper can vary from manufacturer to manufacturer\u2014what's considered smooth for one may be toothy by another\u2014so you have to experiment.\n[2] Cold-press is the most commonly used surface, and if you're taking a beginning watercolor class your instructor will usually specify it on the supply list. There is no standard cold-pressed surface, however; the relative roughness of the paper and size of the grain varies between manufacturers.\n[3] It's the paper in between rough and hot-pressed paper, having a slightly textured surface. Cold-pressed is the most commonly used watercolor paper surface as it allows for a good amount of detail while also having some texture to it. Soft-pressed watercolor paper is in between hot-pressed and cold-pressed, with a slight tooth. It tends to be very absorbent, sucking in paint, making it harder to paint dark or intense colors. Once again it's important to remember that surfaces vary from manufacturer to manufacturer.\n[4] Difference Between Cold Pressed & Hot Pressed Paper. Hot- and cold-pressed papers are used by watercolorists, pastelists,... Watercolor blocks are usually made with sheets of 140-lb., cold-press watercolor paper, ... Watercolor paper is specially designed to for watercolor painting.\n[5] The Difference Between Hot and Cold Press Watercolor Paper. When I was just beginning at watercolor, walking down the paper aisle at any art store was always intimidating. I always knew the thicker the paper the better it was for painting with watercolor. However, I was always curious why some papers were called Cold Pressed and others Hot Pressed.\n[6] 1 Rough paper is really rough, even compared to cold press paper. 2 Cold press is used for a wide variety of watercolor effects from washes to detail work. Hot press is primarily used for detail work due to its smooth finish.\n[7] Best Answer: Hot-pressed watercolor paper has a fine-grained, smooth surface, with almost no tooth. Paint dries very quickly on it. This makes it ideal for large, even washes of color. Cold-pressed watercolor paper has a slightly textured surface, somewhere in between rough and hot-pressed paper. It's the paper used most often by watercolor artists.\n[8] The Paper's Tooth. In watercolor terms, when we are talking about the paper's tooth we are actually talking about the texture or smoothness of the paper's surface. This is where our terms hot and cold pressed originate from. In simple terms, Cold Pressed paper means the paper was designed with a \"bumpy texture or a great deal of tooth. An easy way to remember this is by thinking about yourself bing cold. When you are cold you tend to develop goosebumps.\n[9] I was advised by a water colorist to purchase a more expensive paper. I saw this on Amazon and decided to give it a try. It is the same 140 cold press paper as the other only the price is less expensive. I did a pen and ink drawing with watercolor being used to give it a hint of color. It turn out great.\n[10] To get the best results in your watercolor paintings, you must use the right paper for the job. Two common watercolor paper types are hot pressed paper and cold pressed paper. The names refer to how the paper was made. This process is what creates the differences in texture and performance. Think of hot pressed paper as ironed paper. After it is made, hot pressed paper is pressed flat with hot rollers.\n[11] Hot-pressed watercolor paper has a fine-grained, smooth surface, with almost no tooth. Paint dries very quickly on it. This makes it ideal for large, even washes of one or two colors. It is not as good for multiple layers of washes since there is more paint on the surface and it can get overloaded quickly.\n[12] As with any skill, the key is practice and more practice. A good way to start is to try out the wash strategies described on this page. Buy six or eight medium sized (10x14) watercolor blocks, five or six with rough (R) or cold pressed (CP or NOT) finishes and one or two with a hot pressed (HP) finish.\n[13] Cotman Water Colour Paper Pad - Cold Pressed\/Not Surface (Gummed) (300Gsm\/140Lb) - 10 Sheets.

A firm favourite amongst water colour artists, Cotman Water Colour paper is a good quality mould-made, wood free paper that is internally and externally sized. Cotman paper is acid free for extensive life without deterioration.\n[14] 1 Hot press paper is relatively smooth\u2014memory jogger-think about melting relative to hot press; a melted substance is smooth. 2 Rough paper is really rough, even compared to cold press paper. Cold press is used for a wide variety of watercolor effects from washes to detail work.\n[15] Experimenting with Fabriano's Soft Press watercolor paper I am continuing my experiments with various watercolor papers. This time, I have tried Fabriano's Soft Press 140lb paper. I think this is going to be a winner! Fabriano states that the soft press is somewhere between its hot press and its cold pressed paper. I wanted to try it out for myself with a quick sketch. I started the most typical Venetian scene possible: gondolas facing San Giorgio's.\n[16] The 3 surfaces of Watercolour paper. There are 3 surfaces of watercolour paper: Rough, hot-pressed (HP), and cold-pressed (NOT). Rough \u2013 A pronounced, varied texture, great for a textured loose feel.

The samples are from a Moleskine watercolor notebook cold-pressed (left) and Veneto rough by Hahnemuhle (right). Image: \u00a92007 Marion Boddy-Evans. Licensed to About.com, Inc.\n[18] Rough surface paper is a good choice for transparent watercolors used in a bold and immediate style, as it allows the pigment of color washes to settle into the hollows of the paper. Pastel artists also generally prefer a paper with tooth or texture to grab onto the pastel pigment. Cold Press paper, which is the most popular and versatile, has a slight texture. Handmade papers achieve this by re-pressing a new wet sheet, which smoothes the surface to some degree.\n[19] The color of watercolor paper varies between manufacturers and types of paper, as this photo clearly shows.

Also, there is less caffeine in the darker roasted coffees than in the lighter ones. The roast alone doesn't determine the resulting coffee taste or quality. The origin of the beans makes a big difference. A bean from Ethiopia will taste differently than a bean from India, even if they are both French roast.\n[5] There are, however, wood-fired coffee roasters that can also impart some of the wood-smoke into the beans as they roast, Nothing will stop you from throwing your roasted coffee in a smoker and smoking it further from its current roast level.aving roasted beans for some time and having burnt a couple of batches.

I could drink it, but it certainly does not taste anywhere near as good as fresh ones I bought currently, though they were both the same kind. Roasted coffee beans oxidize and the compounds in the coffee change.\n[9] Quinic acid--a degradation product of chlorogenic acids--is present at twenty times its threshold value and is partly responsible for the perceived bitterness in coffee (McCamey, 176). Furfuryl alcohol is thought to contribute a burnt and bitter taste to coffee (Shibamoto et al., 311).\n[10] I know some people swear that pouring boiling water onto coffee is the only way to ensure that it doesn't cool down too much during the tenth of a second it takes to fall out of the pitcher and hit the grounds. Nah, that's horsefeathers. Coffee always burns unless it's poured into your coffee brewer below 205 F (96 C).\n[11] The jury heard the following evidence in the case: 1 McDonald's Operations Manual required the franchisee to hold its coffee at 180 to 190 degrees Fahrenheit; 2 Coffee at that temperature, if spilled, causes third-degree burns (the worst kind of burn) in three to seven seconds;\n[12] Quinic acid--a degradation product of chlorogenic acids--is present at twenty times its threshold value and is partly responsible for the perceived bitterness in coffee (McCamey, 176). Furfuryl alcohol is thought to contribute a burnt and bitter taste to coffee (Shibamoto et al ., 311).\n[13] To you and me that would feel like tepid coffee. But according to him, it's at that temperature that many of the more subtle flavors of coffee are revealed. What he says makes sense, because if you think about coffee that is really hot, almost hot enough to burn your tongue, you really don't taste much at all. So there is a sliding scale here.\n[14] 1 It cooks out all of the delicate flavors and leaves a bitter taste. 2 Don't leave coffee on the burner. 3 The coffee begins to caramelize and will smell off.. 4 For best results, serve immediately or store in a thermal carafe. 5 Never mix old coffee grounds with new coffee grounds.\n[15] Even in the past when I over roasted in the rotisserie drum and the coffee had a somewhat burnt smell at first, after a few days of rest, it seemed to mellow out and smell pretty good. I have changed my process somewhat and tried to go for a little longer roasts - is this what under roasted or baked coffee would smell like? I need help. Thanks. dickc\n[16] Here's how to tell if coffee has gone bad, and why freshness matters. There's no such thing as a coffee molecule. Coffee \u2014 whether it exists in bean or ground form, or it's sitting in front of you in a cup \u2014 is made up of as many as a thousand different compounds, including carbohydrates, amino acids, and lipids.\n[17] The extreme temperatures in the roasting process of coffee beans depletes the beans of its natural oils. Though it may enhance their aroma, high heat actually causes the oils to become rancid. The chlorogenic acid found in coffee has also been linked to toxic side effects.\n[18] McDonalds coffee was not only hot, it was scalding -- capable of almost instantaneous destruction of skin, flesh and muscle. Here's the whole story. Stella Liebeck of Albuquerque, New Mexico, was in the passenger seat of her grandson's car when she was severely burned by McDonalds' coffee in February 1992.\n[19] There's no such thing as a quick cup of coffee. Our family has been selecting and roasting premium beans for 143 years.here's no such thing as a quick cup of coffee. Our family has been selecting and roasting premium beans for 143 years.\n[20] What is stale coffee? Just as iron is oxidized to form rust, stale coffee is what you get when roasted beans (or grounds) have been oxidized from exposure to oxygen; the more intense the exposure, the more quickly oxidized and stale your coffee will become. Other factors such as heat and moisture can also make oxidation occur.\nSearch Query: is there such a thing as burnt coffee.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

By not having to slam on the brakes at the last minute, you'll improve the efficiency of your car and save gas. 6. Turn Off the Engine. If you're waiting outside for your spouse to finish getting ready for your night out, or you're waiting at a railroad crossing for the train to cross, turn off the engine.\n[2] In rare cases, your car may stall due to what is commonly called a vapor lock, a situation that occurs when the fuel lines supplying gas to the engine become hot enough to boil the gas in the line turning it into vapor. Fuel pumps are designed to pump liquid not \"vapor\" and thus fail to provide enough fuel pressure.. If your car diesels when you turn off the ignition, it means that your car most likely has a carburetor and the idle speed adjustment is too high. Dieseling describes the situation where you turn off the key, yet the car continues to run for a few seconds or longer, eventually sputtering to a stop.\n[3] The consensus advice now is that if you car is stopped for more than a minute, the smart move is to turn the engine off. 1 The arrival of auto stop-start, a technology most often seen in hybrids, does this work for you, and not only if you're idle for minute or more.\n[4] If the light is on, and you're still driving, turn off as many electrical accessories as you can, such as the stereo, air conditioning or heater, and avoid using electrically operated controls such as power windows.\n[5] This leads to the 10-second rule mentioned above: If it looks like you will be idling for longer than 10 seconds, turn off the engine and restart when you are ready to drive. There are plenty of occasions where you might find your car idling. In a long drive through, picking someone up from work, or just sitting in your driveway. If you're idling longer than 10 seconds, though, you're better off turning off the engine. Obviously, it's a bad idea to shut your car off at an intersection. However, a common myth is that you waste more gasoline starting your car than you would by idling. This is technically true, but only for about 5-10 seconds.\n[6] There's not always a warning light to alert you of this, but sometimes your car will be driving fine at road speed, only to die when you slow down and stop. If your engine shuts off at low speed, contact a mechanic immediately for a thorough inspection.\n[7] It's hard to know for sure without looking at the car. Anytime your car dies the oil and battery light will come on, just like if you turn the ignition on without starting the car. The power steering will also quit working as it requires the engine to be running to power the pump. If you ran out of the majority of your oil and continued to drive the engine quickly will seize.\n[8] Finally, while it is a law to turn the car off, I've never once had a gas station attendent tell me turn off my car. These guys work at the gas station so if they felt that there was any danger whatsoever, I'm sure that in my 17 years of driving, at least 1 would've asked me to turn off the car.\n[9] So if you turn off the engine in an area on an decline (front of car angling below rear of car), the car will roll forward. If you are in an incline position (rear of car angling below front of car, then the car will not move, but you cannot remove the keys.\n[10] If you pass a few safe places to pull over, the officer is definitely going to think you're up to something, and that raises suspicion.. Surprisingly, Police Officer Tom also advises you not to turn off your engine, especially if you're driving an old beater that's not reliable.on't pull over in a place that is going to put you or the officer in danger, says Police Officer Tom -- like a narrow left-hand-lane shoulder on a highway.\n[11] 6.

That's less than the $11 people using iTunes or other platforms would pay for a Showtime subscription, the Los Angeles Times pointed out, and on par with the add-on monthly subscription fee for Showtime charged by Hulu.\n[3] HBO is no longer the only premium pay-TV channel to venture outside the bundle. It now has competition from Showtime, which also lets you subscribe without tying you to an expensive package from a third-party service provider. Showtime's streaming service costs $11 per month and is available on Apple devices and Roku media streamers. PlayStation users can also get Showtime through Sony's PlayStation Vue TV service, and subscribers to Hulu's $8-per-month streaming-video service can add Showtime for an extra $9 per month. Much like HBO Now, Showtime's new service has some caveats, restrictions, and other fine-print details.\n[4] 1 Showtime was added to the Apple TV in July 2015 and added support for a new standalone Showtime service that does not require a cable subscription to use and is available for $10.99\/month. 2 This app is different than the Showtime Anytime app which requires a cable subscription to use.\n[5] If you have a PlayStation 3 or PlayStation 4, you can get Showtime through Sony's PlayStation Vue app (with no need for Vue's expensive channel bundles).

Zirconium Oxide is a highly insoluble thermally stable Zirconium source suitable for glass, optic and ceramic applications. Zirconium oxide is a white crystaline oxide also known as zirconia, the cubic crystaline form used in jewlery is rarely found in nature. Oxide compounds are not conductive to electricity.\n[7] They argue that nanoparticles of titanium dioxide and zinc oxide are just as toxic as chemical sunscreens such as oxybenzone and octinoxate that the EWG claims can be absorbed into the skin and cause abnormal activity in the body.\n[8] Zirconium: reactions of elements. Zirconium metal is coated with an oxide layer that usually renders it inactive. However zirconium does burn in air if provoked to form thedioxide zirconium(IV) oxide, ZrO2. Zr(s) + O2(g) \u2192 ZrO2(s) Zirconium does not react with water under normal conditions.\n[9] Elemental titanium and titanium dioxide is of a low order of toxicity. Laboratory animals (rats) exposed to titanium dioxide via inhalation have developed small-localized areas of dark-colored dust deposits in the lungs.\n[10] Zirconium dioxide (ZrO 2), sometimes known as zirconia (not to be confused with zircon), is a white crystalline oxide of zirconium.Its most naturally occurring form, with a monoclinic crystalline structure, is the mineral baddeleyite.irconium dioxide (ZrO 2), sometimes known as zirconia (not to be confused with zircon), is a white crystalline oxide of zirconium.\n[11] Derivatives of ZOC include high purity and stabilised oxides and reactive salts such as zirconium basic sulphate, [\"ZBS\"] and zircon basic carbonate [\"ZBC\"]. ZBS and ZBC are themselves used as intermediates for downstream aqueous zirconium chemicals as well as directly in certain applications.he principal precursor or building block for zirconium chemicals is zirconium oxychloride, known as ZOC. ZOC is produced from zircon sand by a variety of processes, generally involving caustic fusion, dissolution in hydrochloric acid and separation.\n[12] Zirconium dioxide (ZrO. 2), sometimes known as zirconia (not to be confused with zircon), is a white crystalline oxide of zirconium. Its most naturally occurring form, with a monoclinic crystalline structure, is the mineral baddeleyite. A dopant stabilized cubic structured zirconia, cubic zirconia, is synthesized in various colours for use as a gemstone and a diamond simulant. 1 Production, chemical properties, occurrence.\n[13] Zirconium dioxide (ZrO 2) can withstand very high temperatures and is used to make crucibles and to line the walls of high temperature furnaces. Zirconium carbonate (3ZrO 2 \u00b7CO 2 \u00b7H 2 O) is used in lotions to treat poison ivy. Estimated Crustal Abundance: 1.65\u00d710 2 milligrams per kilogram.\n[14] Since the titanium dioxide hexachloroethane & zinc hexachloroethane mixtures form titanium tetrachloride & zinc chloride, respectively, a separate study was performed in which rats were exposed to titanium tetrachloride gas or zinc chloride aerosol.

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: what does cfm mean on a air compressor.\n\n[1] When a compressor pumps one CFM (cubic foot per minute), that means the intake port inhales one cubic foot of free air (air at atmospheric pressure, which is 0 psig) per minute. (Note: A CFM does not mean in any sense the compressed volume.) So the unit really measures the mass of air flowing per minute, not volume per minute, since a cubic foot of free air is a unit of mass.\n[2] A: SCFM, which stands for standard cubic feet per minute, is a numerical rating that shows the quantity of air flow a pneumatic tool requires to function at peak performance. The actual value varies based on the pressure exerted by the air in the compressor, which is typically measured in pounds per inch.\n[3] Travis_King. More reasonable, but considering the air requirement of the motor... The 27 CFM likely refers to SCFM, basically, it's saying that it is moving the mass of 27 cubic feet of free air through the pump each minute at the given pressure. ACFM will depend on pressure, temperature, etc. You can find these calculations online pretty easily by just typing in ACFM to SCFM or vice versa.\n[4] Quick Answer. SCFM, which stands for standard cubic feet per minute, is a numerical rating that shows the quantity of air flow a pneumatic tool requires to function at peak performance. The actual value varies based on the pressure exerted by the air in the compressor, which is typically measured in pounds per inch.\n[5] CFM DELIVERED CUBIC FEET PER MINUTE: Volume of air delivered to the system by the air compressor at ratedpressure. ICFM: \"INLET\" CFM is rated volume of \"Inlet\" air (at \"Inlet\" conditions i.e.:temperature and pressure 14.7 PSIG at sea level) taken in to thecompressor.FM DELIVERED CUBIC FEET PER MINUTE: Volume of air delivered to the system by the air compressor at ratedpressure. ICFM: \"INLET\" CFM is rated volume of \"Inlet\" air (at \"Inlet\" conditions i.e.:temperature and pressure 14.7 PSIG at sea level) taken in to thecompressor.\n[6] Actual air compressor capacity (ACFM) versus standard air capacity (SCFM) and inlet air capacity (ICFM) SCFM - Standard Cubic Feet per Minute. It is common to rate compressed air consumption in Standard Cubic Feet per Minute - SCFM. The SCFM - Standard Cubic Feet per Minute - determines the weight of air to fixed or Standard conditions. There are several definitions of SCFM. The most common used in the United States is with the sea-level properties:\n[7] CFM, or cubic feet per minute, denotes the unit of compressed airflow for air conditioning units. SCFM stands for standard cubic feet per minute, a measurement that takes into account standard conditions. Cubic feet per minute indicates how much air flows through air conditioning as the machinery pushes air through ducts of a building. An air conditioner produces roughly 400 cubic feet per minute per ton of cooling capacity. Keep Learning.\n[8] Flow & Pressure. In the USA flow is normally measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM). You may also see the flow rating in m3\/min, l\/s, or m3\/hr. Basically it's just the volume of air the compressor is supplying and how fast. A cubic foot is 7.48 gallons, so 1 CFM gives you 7.48 gallons of air every minute. Pressure is normally measured in pounds per square inch (psi), but you may also see it as bar, mbar, kg\/cm3, or MPa.\n[9] The rate at which a compressor can deliver a volume of air is noted in cubic feet per minute (cfm). Because atmospheric pressure plays a role in how fast air moves into the cylinder, cfm will vary with atmospheric pressure. It also varies with the temperature and humidity of the air. To set an even playing field, makers calculate standard cubic feet per minute (scfm) as cfm at sea level with 68 degrees F air at 36% relative humidity. Scfm ratings are given at a specific pressure\u20133.0 scfm at 90 psi, for example.\n[10] Higher PSI means the compressor can store more air in the tank, allowing you to operate air tools longer. Cubic feet per minute (CFM) and standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM) describe the volume of air a compressor delivers at specific PSI levels. The CFM value changes as PSI changes.igher PSI means the compressor can store more air in the tank, allowing you to operate air tools longer. Cubic feet per minute (CFM) and standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM) describe the volume of air a compressor delivers at specific PSI levels. The CFM value changes as PSI changes.\n[11] SCFM, the measurement of free air flow. This is one topic, over and above the compressors themselves, that draws a steady stream of visitors to this air compressor information website. I am not too surprised. Even though I think I understand the difference between SCFM, CFM, ACFM and other acronyms that have to do with the measurement of compressed air flow, my definition may not be the one that any specific compressor vendor is using to provide flow characteristics for their machine.\n[12] Find out what CFM means for air compressors. Learn about CFM - cubic feet per minute & measure of the flow rate of air pushed out by a compressor.\n[13] Actual cubic feet per minute (ACFM) is a unit of volumetric flow. It is commonly used by manufacturers of blowers and compressors. This is the actual gas delivery with reference to inlet conditions, whereas cubic foot per minute (CFM) is an unqualified term and should only be used in general and never accepted as a specific definition without explanation.\n[14] Higher PSI means the compressor can store more air in the tank, allowing you to operate air tools longer. Cubic feet per minute (CFM) and standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM) describe the volume of air a compressor delivers at specific PSI levels. The CFM value changes as PSI changes.As you lower the PSI output, CFM increases. A compressor with a higher CFM rating can deliver more air and is better suited for heavier applications such as operating air wrenches and framing nail guns.

A compressor with a higher CFM rating can deliver more air and is better suited for heavier applications such as operating air wrenches and framing nail guns. Compressor manufacturers rate storage tank size in gallons.\n[15] Quick Answer. In air compressors, the abbreviation CFM stands for cubic feet per minute, a measurement of the flow rate of a volume of air. When using an pneumatic-powered tool connected to an air compressor, each tool has a minimum CFM rating for optimal operation. Continue Reading\n[16] First and foremost of the air compressor ratings is \"cfm,\" which is an abbreviation for \"cubic feet per minute.\" Essentially, this rating refers to the number of cubic feet of air a compressor takes in per minute. The higher the \"cfm\" air compressor rating, the more powerful the compressor is and the faster it can take in and put out air. However, the cfm a compressor delivers varies by the psi, or pounds per square inch.\n[17] SCFM, an acronym that stands for standard cubic feet per minute, is a specification that indicates the volume of air an air compressor can provide at a certain pressure. CFM. According to The Air Compressor Exchange of Perrysburg, Ohio, the amount of air taken into a compressor from the outside is indicated by CFM, or cubic feet per minute.\n[18] In the USA flow is normally measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM). You may also see the flow rating in m3\/min, l\/s, or m3\/hr. Basically it's just the volume of air the compressor is supplying and how fast. A cubic foot is 7.48 gallons, so 1 CFM gives you 7.48 gallons of air every minute.\n[19] CFM - Stands for Cubic Feet per Minute. A measurement of airflow that indicates how many cubic feet of air pass by a stationary point in one minute. The higher the number, the more air is being forced through the system. Compressor - The Compressor is the most important piece of a heating or cooling system.\n[20] In the USA flow is normally measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM). You may also see the flow rating in m3\/min, l\/s, or m3\/hr.

However, in the Biology textbook, there are many differences between archaea and bacteria.\n[3] In the past Archaea were classified as an unusual group of bacteria and named archaebacteria, but since the Archaea have an independent evolutionary history and manifest numerous differences in their biochemistry from other forms of life, they are now classified as a separate domain in the three-domain system.n the past Archaea were classified as an unusual group of bacteria and named archaebacteria, but since the Archaea have an independent evolutionary history and manifest numerous differences in their biochemistry from other forms of life, they are now classified as a separate domain in the three-domain system.\n[4] In the past Archaea were classified as an unusual group of bacteria and named archaebacteria, but since the Archaea have an independent evolutionary history and manifest numerous differences in their biochemistry from other forms of life, they are now classified as a separate domain in the three-domain system.aving no cell nucleus, archaea do not reproduce via mitosis; rather, they procreate using a process called binary fission. In this binary fission process, archaeal DNA replicates, and the two strands are pulled apart as the cell grows.\n[5] Some archaea are autotrophs and others are heterotrophs. You might wonder why archaea and bacteria are divided into separate domains. After all, they are both unicellular prokaryotes. In the 1970s, a study revealed that the cellular structures of archaea are so different from bacteria they deserved their own domain.\n[6] Archaebacteria are organisms that are actually very different biochemically and genetically from other bacteria. Hence, archaebacteria is an outdated term, and they are now classified in the Archaea domain. Classifications within this domain are unofficial due to debates over the descendancy of microbes.ydrothermal Vent Archaea. One example in the Archaea domain is Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, currently classified as Archaea: Euryarchaeota: Methanobacteria; Methanobacteriales: Methanobacteriaceae, Methanocaldococcus, and species jannaschii.\n[7] in the past archaea were classified as bacteria and were called archaebacteria but it was discovered that archaea have a distinct evolutionary history and biochemistry compared with bacteria\n[8] Those bacteria that lived at high temperatures or produced methane clustered together as a group well away from the usual bacteria and the eukaryotes. Because of this vast difference in genetic makeup, Woese proposed that life be divided into three domains: Eukaryota, Eubacteria, and Archaebacteria. He later decided that the term Archaebacteria was a misnomer, and shortened it to Archaea. The three domains are shown in the illustration above at right, which illustrates also that each group is very different from the others.

Cartilaginous joints contain cartilage in between them to allow movement.\n[5] A cartilaginous joint is a joint where cartilage connects the bones. Cartilage is a tough but flexible connective tissue that comes in three types: hyaline (also called articular), elastic and fibrocartilage. Unlike the more common synovial joints, cartilaginous joints do not have a space (joint cavity) between the bones.\n[6] 1 Some examples of cartilaginous joints include joints between the ribs and costal cartilage, and the intervertebral disks of the spine. 2 The most common type of joint, the synovial joint, features a fluid-filled space between smooth cartilage pads at the end of articulating bones.ature has solved this problem by dividing the skeleton into many bones and creating joints where the bones intersect. Joints, also known as articulations, are strong connections that join the bones, teeth, and cartilage of the body to one another.\n[7] Cartiliginous Joints. Joints that unite bones with cartilage are called cartilaginous joints. There are two types of cartilaginous joints: (1) A synchrondosis is an immovable cartilaginous joint. One example is the joint between the first pair of ribs and the sternum.(2) A symphysis consists of a compressable fibrocartilaginous pad that connects two bones.ynovial Joints. Synovial joints are characterized by the presence of an articular capsule between the two joined bones. Bone surfaces at synovial joints are protected by a coating of articular cartilage. Synovial joints are often supported and reinforced by surrounding ligaments, which limit movement to prevent injury.\n[8] Cartilaginous (synchondroses and sympheses): These joints occur where the connection between the articulating bones is made up of cartilage for example between vertebrae in the spine. A cartilagenous joint between two vertebrae.\n[9] As the name indicates, at a cartilaginous joint, the adjacent bones are united by cartilage, a tough but flexible type of connective tissue. These types of joints lack a joint cavity and involve bones that are joined together by either hyaline cartilage or fibrocartilage ([link]).There are two types of cartilaginous joints. synchondrosis is a cartilaginous joint where the bones are joined by hyaline cartilage. Also classified as a synchondrosis are places where bone is united to a cartilage structure, such as between the anterior end of a rib and the costal cartilage of the thoracic cage.\n[10] Cartilaginous joints which have layers of hyaline cartilage between the adjoining bones are known as sychondroses joints. Many of these joints are only temporary and are typically found in the growth areas on bodies which have not yet fully developed. As growth plates mature and begin to fuse, these joints become far fewer in number throughout an adult body.\nSearch Query: what are cartilaginous joints.\nRank the 10 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: what happens when no blood flow to foot.\n\n[1] Poor blood circulation means that parts of the body, especially your hands and feet, receive insufficient amount of blood. Once blood reaches your legs and feet, your heart has to pump hard to push the blood \"uphill\" back to the heart and lungs.\n[2] And it may lead to other serious infections that spread beyond your feet if you have a suppressed immune system due to medication, diabetes or other conditions. If you have diabetes, you may have reduced blood circulation and nerve supply in your feet.\n[3] Relief from this pain may occur only when the feet are dangled. Gangrene or death of tissue may occur when nutrition needed for normal growth and repair can no longer be provided because of extensive arterial narrowing (stenosis) or complete blockage (occlusion) of lower extremity arteries.\n[4] If you sit on your leg for ten minutes it stops any blood from getting to your foot. No blood in your foot makes it go numb. When your fight or flight response misfires and the blood rushes away from your foot it's exactly the same thing. No blood in your foot equals numbness and tingling.\n[5] If the blood flow to the foot is reduced, it can result in numb feet due to a lack of oxygen and nutrients reaching the nerves. This can affect how they generate and send impulses. 1) Peripheral Artery Disease: where a build-up of fat and cholesterol narrows the blood vessels.\n[6] Also in rare cases, a blood clot in an artery can suddenly and completely block blood flow to a leg or foot. Often, severe pain, numbness, and coldness develop within 1 hour. This blockage is an emergency. Clot-dissolving medicines, surgical removal of the clot, or bypass surgery is needed to restore blood flow.\n[7] In most cases, foot gangrene is a result of the compromised blood circulation, an insufficient oxygen-rich and nutrient-dense blood supply usually caused by arterial - femoral, popliteal or tibial - obstruction (the human tissue dies from oxygen deficiency more rapidly than when deprived of any other nutrient).\n[8] Poor circulation can make these injuries slow to heal. Sometimes this can lead to amputation of a toe, foot, or leg.\" (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012). Reduced blood flow to the limbs is called peripheral artery disease (or peripheral arterial disease).\n[9] If the blood flow to the foot is reduced, it can result in numb feet due to a lack of oxygen and nutrients reaching the nerves. This can affect how they generate and send impulses. The most common causes of this are: 1) Peripheral Artery Disease: where a build-up of fat and cholesterol narrows the blood vessels.\n[10] No blood flow means that the tissues of her legs will be deprived of oxygen and nutrients and die. This is basically what gangrene is-dead tissue that is rotting.

Fortunately, there are treatments that will reduce the signs of broken blood vessels on face. One of the most common treatments is with lasers. This type of treatment works when the skin absorbs the light from the laser and destroys the capillaries.\n[2] If there is any swelling around the broken vessel, you can use ice to minimize the swelling. There are some remedies that can be purchased directly from the pharmacy which are waterproof and can be applied at the location of a broken blood vessel in the leg. Read also blood clot in arm article.\n[3] Dilated blood vessels can be treated using laser or intense pulsed light. The light is absorbed by hemoglobin inside the blood vessels, causing a heat reaction. The blood coagulates, the walls of the capillary collapse, and the blood vessel is sealed off. Over several weeks, the body gradually absorbs the blood vessel. Generally, several treatments are necessary to diminish the appearance of the vessels.\nSearch Query: how to heal broken blood vessels.\nRank the 3 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Many species of seahorses form pair bonds that last through at least the breeding season. Some species show a higher level of mate fidelity than others. However, many species readily switch mates when the opportunity arises.\n[4] Seahorses are generally small animals averaging around 10cm in height although this is dependent on the species.

Development of the Skyscraper. Sullivan's development of the skyscraper is probably the best example of 'form follows function'.\n[2] Louis Sullivan is one of the great historical figures in American architecture, but most importantly he influenced the language of architecture. Often called America's first truly modern architect, Sullivan argued that a tall building's exterior design (form) should reflect the activities (functions) that take place inside the walls of the building.\n[3] Louis Henri Sullivan facts: Louis Henri Sullivan (1856-1924), American architect, was the link between Henry Hobson Richardson and Frank Lloyd Wright in the development of modern American architecture.\n[4] Louis Sullivan is one of the great historical figures in American architecture, but most importantly he influenced the language of architecture.

Louis Henri Sullivan (1856-1924), American architect, was the link between Henry Hobson Richardson and Frank Lloyd Wright in the development of modern American architecture. Louis Sullivan was born in Boston on Sept. 3, 1856. Always impatient with classroom education, he spent only a year at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he studied with William Ware, the well-known High Victorian Gothic architect.\n[6] Louis Sullivan (1856-1924) grew up during a pivotal moment in American history. The Civil War was about to erupt when Sullivan was only five, and the aftermath of the conflict would provide an important set of opportunities for the young man.\n[7] Visual Arts. Who gave us the most famous phrase in architecture, form ever follows function? Often called America's first truly modern architect, Louis Sullivan (1856-1924) argued that a tall building's exterior design (form) should reflect the activities (functions) that take place inside.\n[8] Louis Sullivan was a major figure in American architecture who grew up during Reconstruction. The Great Chicago Fire had a significant impact on his career in that there was a huge demand for new architects to innovate and rethink traditional modes of design.\n[9] Form follows function is a phrase often heard, not well-understood, and hotly discussed by students and designers for over a century. Who gave us the most famous phrase in architecture and how did Frank Lloyd Wright expand its meaning? Architect Louis Sullivan Born in Boston, Louis Sullivan (1856-1924) helped pioneer the American skyscraper mainly in the Midwest, creating a Sullivanesque style that changed the face of architecture.\n[10] Louis Henri Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright were the two primary influences. While Sullivan did not design residential homes (he was considered the father of the modern skyscraper), his philosophy of form follows function influenced young Frank Lloyd Wright and the other Prairie Style architects. Wright apprenticed six years with Sullivan and his influence can be seen in Wright's early work. Frank Lloyd Wright is the most well-known Prairie Style architect. He and several others shared loft space in the Steinway Piano Company building in Chicago, Illinois, beginning in the 1890s.\n[11] It's not surprising, then, that Sullivan's 1896 phrase form follows function has followed us throughout the ages, sometimes as an explanation, often as a solution, but always as a design idea expounded by one architect in the 19th century.\n[12] This philosophy was best exemplified by Fallingwater (1935), which has been called the best all-time work of American architecture. Wright was a leader of the Prairie School movement of architecture and developed the concept of the Usonian home, his unique vision for urban planning in the United States.\n[13] He would move to Chicago and eventually apprentice under Louis Sullivan, the father of modernism.. By the time of his passing, Wright's resume included more than 500 works, most famous of which are Fallingwater and New York City's Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.\n[14] Modern architecture breaks away from cookie-cutter design and traditional aesthetics. It strives to create home designs that go beyond \"standard\" ideas and instead pursue projects inspired by layout, location, and function. Frank Lloyd Wright's mentor, Louis Sullivan famously stated that, \"Form follows function\".\n[15] Johanna Anne Mansfield Sullivan Macy (April 14, 1866 \u2013 October 20, 1936), better known as Anne Sullivan, was an American teacher, best known for being the instructor and lifelong companion of Helen Keller.\nSearch Query: louis sullivan is best known for the development of.\nRank the 15 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.
